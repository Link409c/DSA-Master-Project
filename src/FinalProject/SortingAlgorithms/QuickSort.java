 * Quick Sort, like Merge Sort, uses the divide and conquer idea to split and sort a list of elements.
 * For each pass through the list, the sorting algorithm chooses a pivot point in the middle of the list.
 * Then, each element is compared to the pivot, being placed before or after it if they are smaller or
 * larger than the pivot respectively.
